Hi, I'm Elouan GOUINGUENET.

In daytime, I'm a Software engineer.<br/>
At night time, I turn into a passionate video games lover!

TypeScript / Svelte lover. Currently highly interested in Rust.
I recently fall into the NeoVim trap and his endless configuration.

You can reach me at elouangouinguenet@yahoo.fr
