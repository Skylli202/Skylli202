Hi, I'm Elouan GOUINGUENET.

In daytime, I'm a Software engineer currently working on the ERP Sage X3.
At night time, I turn into a passionate video games lover!

Currently highly interested in Rust, TDD and svelte/sveltekit! <br/>
Other stack I love : 
- Symfony
- Vue.js

I love optimizing my job with tooling perfectly configured to my needs like Linter, Test framework, pipeline and more.
